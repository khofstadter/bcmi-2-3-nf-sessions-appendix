# Appendix for Neurofeedback Sessions Project

This repository contains information for my Neurofeedback Sessions project testing auditory entrainment and neurofeedback in my doctoral research.

This folder contains: 
- `\b` (3 NF sessions: filled in questionnaires, notes, plots, consent forms)
- `\m` (same as `\b`)
- `questionnaire-en.md` (questionnaire in Chinese)
- `questionnaire-zh.pdf` (questionnaire in English)
- `questionnaires-answers-summery-en.xls` (answered questionnaire summery with analysis in sheets)
- `supercollider-plotting-code.scd` (superCollider code for plotting BCMI data)

Unfortunately, in **session b1**, the audio-video file recording started after the adjustment of impedance, however, measurements were archived by screen-shots (archived in relevant folder).

_supporting material_:
- [YouTube Video Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRr9g36OjY6-48a-AdKazkDrB6QyGStmp) | Audio-video archive of 6 neurofeedback sessions and a short video introducing the environment where the sessions took place.
