## Introducing the study

In this study I play some music based on shamanic traditions while recording your brainwaves. A goal of shamanic drumming is to help dive into an altered state of mind to seek some clarify on a particular question. The music plays for 30 minutes. When it starts playing, please close your eyes and if possible keep them closed until the music plays. Try to keep your spine as straight as possible, slow down your breathing, relax - and find a question that you would like your altered state of mind help with. Shamans believe that in these sessions, clarification often comes to us in abstract forms (visuals and sound), for instance like in a dream. Try to focus on the drumming as much as possible - but consider this focusing more as a ‘feeling’ than a ‘thinking’. Try to let go of your internal conversation with yourself. After the session, if you had any interesting ideas, please use the pencil and paper to bring back your memories, draw a storyline.

## Part II - Listening

(setup + 30 minutes listening with NF)

## Part III - Post-Listening

1. How do you feel, are you focused or tired?
2. Was it easy or difficult to ‘feel’ the drumming?
3. Was it easy or difficult to pause your internal dialogue?

Please draw any interesting ideas on the paper.

Thank you, Krisztian
